# Quantity Feature Implementation Summary

## Overview
Added full quantity selection and management functionality to the shopping cart system.

## Changes Made

### 1. Cart Storage Format
**Before:** Array of product IDs
```javascript
["prod1", "prod2", "prod3"]
```

**After:** Object with product IDs as keys and quantities as values
```javascript
{
  "prod1": 2,
  "prod2": 1,
  "prod3": 5
}
```

### 2. Cart Display (cart.html)
Added interactive quantity selector with + and - buttons:
- **Quantity Controls:** DaisyUI "join" component with decrease (-) and increase (+) buttons
- **Visual Display:** Shows quantity in a read-only input field between buttons
- **Subtotal:** Each item now shows individual subtotal (price × quantity)
- **Price Display:** Changed to show "price per item" and "subtotal"

### 3. Cart Functionality (cart.js)
Updated functions to support quantities:

**loadCartItems():**
- Now reads cart data as object instead of array
- Calculates total by multiplying price × quantity for each item
- Passes quantity to createCartItemElement()

**createCartItemElement():**
- Added quantity parameter
- Displays quantity selector with + and - buttons
- Shows subtotal per product
- Uses DaisyUI join component for button grouping

**updateQuantity():**
- New function to handle quantity changes
- Prevents quantity from going below 1
- Updates localStorage and refreshes display

**removeItemFromCart():**
- Updated to work with object format (uses delete instead of filter)

**handleCheckout():**
- Updated to check Object.keys().length instead of array.length

**updateCartCountNavbar():**
- Updated to count unique products (Object.keys().length)

### 4. Add to Cart Behavior (shop.js, product.js)
**Before:** 
- Could only add product once
- Showed "Item already in cart!" alert if trying to add again

**After:**
- First click: Adds product with quantity 1
- Subsequent clicks: Increases quantity by 1
- Shows "Added" feedback each time
- No more "already in cart" alerts

**Updated Functions:**
- `handleAddToCart()` in shop.js
- `handleAddToCart()` in product.js
- `updateCartCount()` in both files

## User Experience Flow

### Adding Products
1. User clicks "Add to Cart" on any product
2. Product is added with quantity = 1 (or quantity increased if already in cart)
3. Cart badge updates in navbar
4. Button shows "Added" feedback

### Managing Cart
1. User navigates to cart.html
2. Each product shows:
   - Product image and name
   - Price per item
   - Quantity selector (- [qty] +)
   - Subtotal for that product
   - Remove button
3. User can:
   - Click + to increase quantity
   - Click - to decrease quantity (minimum 1)
   - Click Remove to delete item completely
4. Total updates automatically

### Checkout

## Technical Details

### Data Structure
```javascript
// localStorage key: cart_user@email.com
{
  "prod1": 3,    // 3 units of product 1
  "prod17": 1,   // 1 unit of product 17
  "prod28": 2    // 2 units of product 28
}
```

### Cart Count Badge
- Shows number of unique products (not total quantity)
- Example: If cart has 3 of prod1 and 2 of prod2, badge shows "2"

### Files Modified
1. ✅ `js/cart.js` - Complete quantity management
2. ✅ `js/shop.js` - Updated add to cart behavior
3. ✅ `js/product.js` - Updated add to cart behavior

### Files Unchanged
